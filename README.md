# Discrete-Time-CBF
Control Barrier Functions Simulations in case of discrete time, high order discrete time, or adaptive

# Testing a 3-link manipulator 
Joints are constrained as well as control input is constrained. Nominal controller designed using PID (PD controller).
Reference trajectory - sinusoidal and exceeding allowed joint range.
